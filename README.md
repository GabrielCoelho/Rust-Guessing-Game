# Rust-Guessing-Game
Rust Documentation's Guessing Game with a little twist on the printed expected error when the user input something else than a number. 

None pre skills where used, only instructions given by the documentation. I've inputed that based on the instructions given when it presented the `break;` statement on loops.
